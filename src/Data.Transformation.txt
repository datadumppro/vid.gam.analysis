1)  Create 2 tables.  The first table shows the average critic score for Sports games.  Store this information in a column called “sports_critic_scofre”.  The second table shows the average critic score for Shooter games.  Store this information in a column called “shooter_critic_score”.

 

Since this assignment did not specially state that data had been loaded into hive and stored in a table previously create I would begin by setting up my cluster, uploading data to hive, then head input the following SQL:

CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE survey

(

name string,

platform string,

year_of_release int,

genre string,

publisher string,

na_sales float,
CREATE TABLE sales_genre

(

Genre string,

Global_Sales float,

Critic_Score float

);

*EXECUTE*

 

SELECT AVG(critic_score) AS sports_critic_score

FROM sales_genre

WHERE genre LIKE “%sports%”;

*EXECUTE*

 

SELECT AVG(critic_score) AS shooter_critic_score

FROM sales_genre

WHERE genre LIKE “%shooter%”;

*EXECUTE*

 

 

2) Create 3 statistics tables (average, min, max) for the global_sales for:  all games, Sports games, Shooter games.  For each table, label the columns as: “average_global_sales”, “min_global_sales”, and “max_global_sales”.

 

SELECT AVG(global_sales) AS average_global_sales, MIN(global_sales) AS min_global_sales, MAX(global_sales) AS max_global_sales

FROM sales_genre;

*EXECUTE*

 

SELECT AVG(global_sales) AS average_global_sales, MIN(global_sales) AS min_global_sales, MAX(global_sales) AS max_global_sales

FROM sales_genre;

WHERE genre LIKE “%shooter%”;

*EXECUTE*

 

SELECT AVG(global_sales) AS average_global_sales, MIN(global_sales) AS min_global_sales, MAX(global_sales) AS max_global_sales

FROM sales_genre;

WHERE genre LIKE “%sports%”

*EXECUTE*

 

3)  Create 2 tables containing the global_sales and the count of games with that global_sales for: Sports games and Shooter games.  For each table, label the columns as: “global_sales” and “count”.

 
SELECT ROUND(global_sales) AS global_sales, COUNT(global_sales) AS count

FROM sales_genre

WHERE genre LIKE “%sports%”

GROUP BY global_sales

*EXECUTE*

SELECT ROUND(global_sales) AS global_sales, COUNT(global_sales) AS count

FROM sales_genre

WHERE genre LIKE “%shooter%”

GROUP BY global_sales

*EXECUTE*
